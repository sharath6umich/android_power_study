# android_power_study

Introduction
===============
The goal of the study is to study the power comsumption of android phone. This can depend on below factors:
 - CPU influenced primarily by CPU utilization and frequency
 - By performing tasks based on differing intensity of computations 
 - Turn OLED On/Off, differing intensity of brightness.
 - WindowManager.LayoutParams Class can used to control brightness of screen
 - Measure power consumption when not used vs used at different volumes (audioManager Class, setStreamVolume).
 
 This is an android application designed for Samsung Galaxy S4. This android app apk is included in the project for installation. This application essentially runs CPU intensive computations
 
 Instructions for Installation
 ==============================
 
  - go to Settings -> Security
  - check Unknown sources, and you are all set to install this app
  - the apk file in in \bin\cpu.apk, you can add this to youe S4 phone and install like any other apk file by clicking on it from you preferred android file manager
